Node JS is runtime environment to use the javascript on server side, command line interfaces.
Node JS is not a programming language. The runtime is something that provides custom functionality so various tools
and libraries specific to an environment. For example add a button click event or manipulate the DOM.
But NodeJS provides various tools like libraries for setting up the node server, integrating with file system to read
and write the file from disk.

The main object in NodeJS is global
and 'process' object which gives us various properties and methods to manipulate the NodeJS Process.

**NodeJS is able to teach javascript new things by providing C++ bindings to the V8 engine.**
This allows JavaScript in essence to do anything that C++ can do and C++ can indeed access the file
system. So now JavaScript can access the file system through node that's where we're going to stop for this.
